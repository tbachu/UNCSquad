### Core Agent Workflow
1. **Receive user input** - Natural language processing of user requests
2. **Retrieve relevant memory** - Access user preferences, history, and patterns
3. **Plan sub-tasks** - Break down complex requests using ReAct pattern
4. **Call tools/APIs** - Execute tasks using Gemini API
5. **Generate final response** - Compile results into actionable insights

### Core Modules

#### `src/planner.py` & `lib/agent/planner.ts`
- Breaks down user goals into sub-tasks
- Implements ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) pattern
- Prioritizes tasks based on context

#### `src/executor.py` & `lib/agent/executor.ts`
- Executes tasks using Gemini API
- Handles image analysis, recipe generation, and recommendations
- Manages API calls and response parsing

#### `src/memory.py` & `lib/agent/memory.ts`
- Stores user preferences and interaction history
- Tracks achievements and statistics
- Analyzes patterns for personalization
