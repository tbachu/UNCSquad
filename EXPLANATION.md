# HIA Agent Reasoning and Technical Explanation

## 1. Agent's Reasoning Process

### Overview
HIA employs a sophisticated reasoning process that combines pattern recognition, medical knowledge, and contextual understanding to provide accurate health insights.

### Reasoning Steps

1. **Intent Classification**
   ```python
   # Example reasoning chain
   User: "Check my cholesterol and tell me if I should worry"
   
   Agent Thought Process:
   - Keywords detected: "cholesterol", "worry" (concern indicator)
   - Intent: Document analysis + risk assessment
   - Required actions: Extract values → Compare to ranges → Assess risk → Provide guidance
   ```

2. **Context Integration**
   - Retrieves user's historical cholesterol values
   - Considers age, gender if available
   - Checks for related conditions (diabetes, heart disease)
   - Factors in current medications

3. **Multi-Step Analysis**
   - Step 1: Extract all lipid panel values (Total, LDL, HDL, Triglycerides)
   - Step 2: Compare each to standard ranges
   - Step 3: Calculate ratios (Total/HDL)
   - Step 4: Assess cardiovascular risk
   - Step 5: Generate personalized recommendations

### Decision Making
The agent uses a confidence-based approach:
- **High Confidence**: Clear abnormalities or normal values
- **Medium Confidence**: Borderline values requiring context
- **Low Confidence**: Insufficient data or ambiguous results

## 2. Memory Usage

### Memory Architecture

```python
class MemorySystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.working_memory = {}      # Current session
        self.episodic_memory = ChromaDB()  # Past interactions
        self.semantic_memory = SQLite()    # Health knowledge
```

### Memory Strategies

1. **Selective Attention**
   - Prioritizes recent and relevant information
   - Filters out redundant data
   - Maintains focus on user's current concern

2. **Context Window Management**
   ```python
   # Example: Building context for Q&A
   def build_context(self, query):
       # Get last 3 relevant documents
       recent_docs = self.episodic_memory.search(query, limit=3)
       # Get related health metrics
       metrics = self.semantic_memory.get_related_metrics(query)
       # Combine for comprehensive context
       return combine_context(recent_docs, metrics)
   ```

3. **Memory Consolidation**
   - Summarizes lengthy documents
   - Extracts key facts for quick retrieval
   - Updates health profile after each interaction

## 3. Planning Style

### ReAct Pattern Implementation

HIA uses an enhanced ReAct pattern with medical domain knowledge:

```
Observation → Thought → Action → Result → Reflection
```

Example:
```
Observation: User uploaded lab report PDF
Thought: Need to extract and analyze blood work results
Action: Parse PDF and extract all numeric values
Result: Found 15 lab values including CBC and metabolic panel
Reflection: Two values are abnormal - need detailed analysis

Thought: High glucose (126 mg/dL) suggests diabetes risk
Action: Check if fasting glucose and look for HbA1c
Result: Confirmed fasting glucose, no HbA1c present
Reflection: Recommend follow-up testing for diabetes diagnosis
```

### Adaptive Planning
- **Conditional Branching**: Different paths based on findings
- **Priority Scheduling**: Urgent findings analyzed first
- **Resource Optimization**: Batches API calls when possible

## 4. Tool Integration Details

### Tool Selection Matrix

| Input Type | Primary Tool | Fallback | Use Case |
|------------|--------------|----------|----------|
| PDF (text) | PyPDF2 | Gemini Vision | Lab reports |
| PDF (scan) | Tesseract | Gemini Vision | Old records |
| Image | Gemini Vision | Tesseract | Photos of documents |
| Question | Gemini + Context | Gemini Raw | Health Q&A |
| Metrics | SQLite | In-memory | Trend analysis |

### Integration Patterns

1. **Gemini Integration**
   ```python
   async def analyze_with_gemini(self, text, task_type):
       # Craft specialized prompts
       if task_type == "lab_analysis":
           prompt = self._build_lab_analysis_prompt(text)
       elif task_type == "medication_review":
           prompt = self._build_medication_prompt(text)
       
       # Add safety and context
       full_prompt = f"{self.system_prompt}\n{prompt}"
       
       # Execute with retries
       return await self._call_with_retry(full_prompt)
   ```

2. **Document Parser Chain**
   ```
   File Upload → Format Detection → Text Extraction → 
   Metric Extraction → Validation → Storage
   ```

## 5. Known Limitations and Mitigations

### Technical Limitations

1. **OCR Accuracy** (70-90% on handwritten text)
   - Mitigation: Confidence scoring and manual verification prompts
   - Future: Fine-tuned medical handwriting model

2. **Context Window** (32k tokens)
   - Mitigation: Document summarization and chunking
   - Future: Streaming processing for large documents

3. **Medical Knowledge Cutoff**
   - Current: Up to training data date
   - Mitigation: Integrated medical APIs for latest guidelines
   - Future: Continuous learning from medical databases

### Functional Limitations

1. **Diagnostic Boundaries**
   ```python
   # Example safeguard
   if "diagnose" in user_query or "what disease" in user_query:
       return "I can help analyze your results, but please consult " \
              "a healthcare provider for diagnosis."
   ```

2. **Emergency Detection**
   - Can flag critical values
   - Cannot assess clinical urgency
   - Always recommends immediate medical attention for critical findings

### Privacy Limitations

1. **API Data Processing**
   - Data sent to Gemini for analysis
   - Mitigation: No PII in prompts when possible
   - Future: On-device LLM for sensitive data

2. **Multi-User Scenarios**
   - Current: Single user design
   - Mitigation: Session isolation
   - Future: Full multi-tenant architecture

## 6. Agent Workflow

HIA processes health-related requests through an intelligent agent workflow:

### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Receive User Input**
   - User uploads medical document (PDF, image, text)
   - User asks health-related question
   - User requests trend analysis or report

2. **Context Retrieval**
   - Memory store queries relevant historical data
   - ChromaDB performs semantic search on past documents
   - SQLite retrieves structured metrics and medications

3. **Task Planning (ReAct Pattern)**
   - Planner analyzes input to identify intent
   - Decomposes complex requests into atomic tasks
   - Creates dependency graph for task execution
   - Example: "Analyze my lab report" becomes:
     - Extract text from document
     - Identify lab values
     - Compare with reference ranges
     - Check historical trends
     - Generate insights

4. **Tool Execution**
   - Executor runs tasks in dependency order
   - Calls appropriate tools:
     - Gemini API for text/image analysis
     - Health APIs for drug/reference data
     - Document parser for extraction
     - Visualizer for charts

5. **Result Synthesis**
   - Aggregates results from all tasks
   - Gemini generates natural language insights
   - Stores results in memory for future reference
   - Returns formatted response to user

## 2. Key Modules
