# üè• HIA Q&A Demo - How It Works Now!

## The Q&A Bot Now Understands Your Documents! 

### What's Fixed:

1. **Full Document Storage** - The app now stores the complete text of all uploaded documents
2. **Context-Aware Responses** - Q&A bot has access to ALL your uploaded documents
3. **Specific Answers** - Bot quotes exact values from YOUR documents
4. **Multi-Document Support** - Can answer questions across multiple uploaded files

### Example Questions That Work:

After uploading `test_document.txt`, try these:

```
Q: What was John Doe's glucose level?
A: According to the lab results document, John Doe's glucose level was 95 mg/dL.

Q: Are my cholesterol values normal?
A: Based on your lab results, your total cholesterol is 180 mg/dL, which is within the normal range (less than 200 mg/dL is considered desirable)...

Q: What did the doctor say about my health?
A: According to the doctor's notes in your document, the doctor stated that "Patient is in good health. All values are within normal range. Continue current lifestyle and medication regimen."

Q: Compare my LDL and HDL cholesterol
A: From your lab results:
- LDL Cholesterol: 110 mg/dL 
- HDL Cholesterol: 60 mg/dL
Your HDL (good cholesterol) is at a healthy level (60+ is protective), while your LDL is in the near-optimal range...
```

### How to Use:

1. **Upload Documents First**
   - Go to "Document Analysis" tab
   - Upload one or more medical documents
   - Wait for analysis to complete

2. **Check Loaded Documents**
   - Look at the sidebar - it shows loaded documents
   - Or go to Q&A tab - it shows how many documents are loaded

3. **Ask Specific Questions**
   - Reference specific values: "What was my glucose?"
   - Ask about recommendations: "What did the doctor recommend?"
   - Compare values: "How do my current results compare to normal?"
   - Ask about trends: "Did any values change?"

### What Makes It Work:

The Q&A bot now:
- ‚úÖ Reads the FULL TEXT of all your documents
- ‚úÖ Includes document names and timestamps
- ‚úÖ Has access to extracted metrics
- ‚úÖ Remembers your chat history
- ‚úÖ Provides document-specific answers

### Pro Tips:

1. **Be Specific** - "What was my glucose?" works better than "tell me about my health"
2. **Reference Documents** - "In my lab report..." helps the bot focus
3. **Ask Follow-ups** - The bot remembers your conversation
4. **Upload Multiple Files** - Bot can cross-reference between documents

### Try This Workflow:

1. Upload `test_document.txt`
2. Once analyzed, go to Q&A tab
3. Ask: "What were all of John Doe's test results?"
4. Then ask: "Which values are most important to monitor?"
5. Finally ask: "What should John discuss with his doctor?"

The bot will give you specific answers based on YOUR documents, not generic health information!
